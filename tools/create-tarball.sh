# Create a `lzip` archive and make a detached GPG signature for it.

# When tag name is supplied, it's used to create archive. If there is no tag
# name supplied, latest tag is used.

# Requires:
#   * GPG
#   * git
#   * lzip

# use GPG_KEY_ID for selecting the GPG key to use
# GPG_KEY_ID can be a fingerprint like 0xDEADDEAD or an email address in the
# format <example@example.com>

# usage:
#   ./$script [GPG_KEY_ID]
